### Few words about

Site`s main users are women who can handle with "internet" =) Therefore correct display on mobile devices must be the most important thing.<br>
That is why i've spent a lot of time on responsive markup to ensure that the site looks "pretty" on all devices. (all timings are listed below)

Once site is downloaded to your phone navigation should work even without internet connection.<br>
[Demonstration](http://kudrik.github.io/about) of page loading without page reloading.

Pagination on mobile devices is not a good idea. It is really hard to hit those small pagination links.<br>
So i've added virtual scroll into Leaderboard. It dynamically adds only visible elements and keeps DOM clean and light.

All animations used are composite-layers-repaint-free (that means great performance 60FPS even on old mobile devices) 


### Few words about css

Css modules of components are held via root sass-style class name. <br>
This class name is the same as React component name therefore we get a unique class name preventing "fight" of styles of different components.<br> 
I can update to cssModule "component-class-hash" class naming auto generation if needed.

I've used 'flexbox' layout just to try it. That is why IE9 is not supported. But i can update project to support it if nedeed.
